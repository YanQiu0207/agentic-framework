## Concord — shared work-state for coding agents

<!-- concord:workflow-version=6 -->

This project uses Concord MCP. Keep coordination to the five workflow tools:

- **Before editing**, call `start_work` with the task, your agent kind, and
  expected files or modules. It registers presence, accepts assigned work when
  appropriate, claims the scope, and returns overlap warnings. Concord derives
  your `agent_id` from your session — omit it unless your client told you one.
- Use `inspect_work` to read the workspace, one task, one agent, or one message
  thread. Use `update_work` for durable progress and for live prompts/replies
  to another promptable workspace agent, including while that agent is busy.
- Use `transfer_work` for assignment, acceptance, decline, release,
  reassignment, evidence-bearing handoff offers, and reopening.
- **Before finishing**, call `finish_work` once with the outcome, changed
  files, tests, assumptions, decisions, risks, guardrails, and provenance. It
  records evidence and can mark work review-ready or terminal.

Keep each claim small and resolve reported overlaps before editing. Concord
regenerates human-readable review artifacts in `.concord/`.

Enforcement remains client-dependent. `concord doctor` reports setup and
workflow adoption; optional hooks can block exact-file collisions.

In Grok Build, keep this session reachable while idle by starting one persistent
monitor for `concord inbox watch --provider grok`. Do not start a duplicate when that monitor is active.

In Cursor, start exactly one Cursor background Shell task for `concord inbox watch --provider cursor --once`.
Leave it active when the turn ends. When Cursor resumes you with its completion,
answer the emitted peer message and immediately start a fresh background monitor.

In Gemini CLI, start the exact monitor command supplied by the SessionStart hook
(`concord inbox watch --agent <agent-id> --provider gemini --once`) with `run_shell_command` and `is_background: true`. Project
settings inject background completion into the agent. Answer the peer message,
then immediately start a fresh background monitor.
